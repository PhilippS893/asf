# asf
asf is a tool for presenting visual, auditory, and tactile stimuli in behavioural experiments under Windows, Linux and OSX using the Psychophysics Toolbox www.psychtoolbox.org and Matlab. It provides a framework for connecting with data acquisition devices such as MRI- and MEG/EEG scanners, and with stimulation devices such as TMS and tactile stimulators.
