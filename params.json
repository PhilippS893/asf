  "body": "# asf\r\nASF stands for A Simple Framework for presenting visual and auditory stimuli in behavioral experiments. It is based on the Psychophysics Toolbox for Matlab www.psychtoolbox.org, which needs to be installed for ASF to run. For simple experiments ASF reduces the experimenterâ€™s task of programming behavioral experiments to generating tables of stimulus- and trial descriptions while accurate timing of prefabricated stimuli, collecting responses from different devices such as voice-keys, button boxes or a computer mouse, generating triggers for EEG/MEG equipment and synchronization with MR-scanners and response-logging are dealt with in the background.\r\nAdvanced users find a structured framework for writing plugins that can render animated stimuli online, and that allows implementing adaptive procedures.  \r\n\r\n## Introductory Material\r\nASF is described in \r\nSchwarzbach, J. (2011). A simple framework (ASF) for behavioral\r\nand neuroimaging experiments based on the psychophysics toolbox for MATLAB. Behav Res 43, 1194-1201.\r\n\r\n## Website\r\nThis website is under construction.\r\n\r\n-Overview [myself](https://github.com/jvschw/asf/blob/gh-pages/index.html)\r\n-Tutorials\r\n-Examples\r\n \r\n\r\n",
